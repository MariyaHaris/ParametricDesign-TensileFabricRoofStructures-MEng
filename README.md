# ParametricDesign-TensileFabricRoofStructures-MEng

Hello! This is a repository containing all the files I made during my MEng project.
This repository is referencing in the appendix of my report so that you can have a closer look at the files (but it is not necessary to do so as I have described all my working and included relevant screenshots in the report)

Below is a list of plugins need for the grasshopper files to work properly. 
You can install them by using the packagemanager command in Rhino and then typing the relevant name.
You can also download any that don't pop up on packagemanger off Food4Rhino (https://www.food4rhino.com/en) and Grasshopperdocs (https://grasshopperdocs.com/).

Have fun with Grasshopper!
